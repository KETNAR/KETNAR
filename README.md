- 👋 Hi, I’m @KETNAR
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Downloading essential, free software that needlessly demands I 'sign in' for a free download despite the software being free of charge and open source/GPL.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... How much I hate doing the above.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... How to make Activestate stop doing the above.
- 📫 How to reach me ... Just ask Activestate, they now have my email, name, sock size, sexual prefrence, planet of origin and my current orbit.
- Notes: Marketing makes me break out in a violent rash that results in me attacking people with a rusty and/or dull cheese grater.
 
 PS: Yes, I'm 'that guy' from quake. Yes I code. No I don't use online repos for my code. I use notepad++/Vi/AFP (Actual Freaking Paper). 
 I have assembler code that is older, more complex, and more widely distributed than you. I like scripting in reverse polish notation because it's funny.
